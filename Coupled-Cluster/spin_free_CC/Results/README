In h2o2/aTZ test case, only 45 virtuals have ONs less than 1e-5. 1e-5 is a fairly tight cutoff by the way :) Actually only 14 virtuals have ONs less than 1e-6. This is a fairly tight system.
The main motivation behind this technique is to apply it to ghost systems. For regular molecules,
this method is not good unless there is a lot of sparsity in the wavefunction.

So, when I remove 45 virtuals, the errors are close to 6~7 % in MVG when I construct the density
using zero frequency amplitudes. However, the errors in the VG are close to 13-14%

I can expect errors like that by the way: When I am removing 45 virtuals, I am removing 
ONs close to 1e-5. Ofcourse, the errors are large.


A natural question is that is length-gauge results also this much sensitive ???

It seems like the length gauge results are not that much sensitive. 
Even though, the eigenvalue spectrum in the lg case is nearly the same as that in the vg
case, I am getting ~1-2% error with full CCSD density. compared to an upwards of 
10 % in the velocity gauge case. There is something going in velocity gauge,
which I need to figure out!! Why so sensitive ??

Ofcourse since MVG results are difference of VG results, the errors are a bit lesser than VG.
