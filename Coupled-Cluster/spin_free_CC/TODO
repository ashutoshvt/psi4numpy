Separate helper modules for all the core utilities.
1.  ccenergy
2.  cclambda
3.  cchbar
4.  ccresponse
5.  cclinresp
6.  localization_PAO
7.  cc2energy
8.  cc2lambda
9.  cc2hbar
10. cc2response
11. cc2linresp
12. dens_linresp_cc
13. dens_linresp_cc2
14. D2(ij_ab)
15. polarizability
16. rotation - length gauge
17. rotation - modified velocity gauge

After making all these helper modules create 
a proper implementation file for submission and
running. That would be very clean


Final scripts that should be run:

1. helper_guess_density.py

what should it take as arguments:
1. psi4_options for scf (molecule, basis, convergence, etc) 
2. guess : cc2 or ccsd or cis(d) etc. .. with iteration structure for ccenergy, cclambda, ccresponse. ex. cc2, 1, 0, 3.
3. property(rotation, polarizability)
4. a list of cartesian corrdinates: [X(XX), Y(YY), Z(ZZ)]
5. Gauge? if polarizability error if gauge is not length
6. should return 1, 2 or 3 bases depending on the cartesian coordinates.

what should it print:
sparsity analysis of the density: its eigenvalue structure

Once we have the new basis from eigenvectors of the guess density, 
lets proceed with calculation of the property in this basis.
