Up till now,

the best so far is MUMU_SD and then MUMU_D
i.e singles can't be frozen.
Let me see if I can get the same behavior 
for L-PNO as well.
Let me code L-PNO in two days and test this
while running cc2 calculations on bigger molecules 
in the FVNO++ code. So, let me fix my helper_cc2_exp code
first

Also check your PNO code with h2_7 first in cc2.
